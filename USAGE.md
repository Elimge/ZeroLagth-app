### The Dashboard: Discovering Destinations

The dashboard is your main hub for finding new and exciting places. It is automatically organized into four quadrants to facilitate discovery, **based on the interests you selected upon login**.

*   **Tus Preferencias (Your Preferences):** Displays destinations that directly match your selected interest categories. These are the places we think you'll love!
*   **Lugares Relacionados (Related Places):** Here you'll find destinations from categories similar to your interests. For example, if you like "Cultural" places, you might see "Historical" sites here.
*   **Podr√≠a Interesarte (You Might Like):** A selection of other popular destinations that might catch your eye.
*   **Otros Lugares (Other Places):** The rest of the available locations, so you don't miss out on anything.

In this section, your goal is to explore and add places you like to your favorites list by clicking the **heart icon (‚ù§Ô∏è)**.

### Building Your Route: The Trip Planner

This is where the magic happens! The **"Arma tu Ruta"** (Build Your Route) page transforms your list of favorites into a smart, prioritized travel plan. Unlike the Dashboard, **here you have full control** to classify each location.

1.  **Go to the Planner:** Click on "Arma tu Ruta" in the sidebar. You will see a card for each destination you've added to your favorites.

2.  **Classify Each Destination:** For each place, the application will ask you to answer two simple but powerful questions:
    *   **¬øEs Urgente? (Is it Urgent?):** Do you feel this visit can't wait?
    *   **¬øEs Importante? (Is it Important?):** Does this place have high personal value or is it key to your trip?

3.  **Define Pros and Cons (New!):** Immediately after classifying a destination, the application will prompt you to list the **pros** (benefits of going) and the **cons** (disadvantages of not going). This step is key for two reasons:
    *   It helps you reflect on why you want to visit the location.
    *   It enables **automatic browser notifications** to remind you of your visit if the destination has a scheduled event date.

4.  **View Your Suggested Route:** As you classify your places, a prioritized itinerary will appear and update at the bottom, organized according to the Eisenhower Matrix:
    *   **üî• ¬°Hazlo Ahora! (Do It Now!):** Important and Urgent. These are your top priorities.
    *   **üóìÔ∏è Planifica (Plan):** Important, but Not Urgent. Valuable activities you can schedule with less rush.
    *   **‚ö° Delega o Hazlo R√°pido (Delegate or Do It Quick):** Urgent, but Not Important. Tasks that should be done soon but aren't critical to your main goals.
    *   **üóëÔ∏è Considera Omitir (Consider Omitting):** Not Important and Not Urgent. Places you could skip if you're short on time.

### Admin Panel (For Administrators)

If you are logged in as an administrator, you will see an **"Admin"** link in the sidebar. This panel allows you to manage all the destinations in the app.

1.  **View All Destinations:** The panel displays a table with all current locations.
2.  **Add a Destination:** Click the **"Agregar Lugar"** button to open a form and add a new place.
3.  **Edit a Destination:** Click the **pencil icon (‚úèÔ∏è)** in the "Acciones" column to modify an existing destination's details.
4.  **Delete a Destination:** Click the **trash can icon (üóëÔ∏è)** to permanently remove a destination.
